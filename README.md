# Comparison-of-Music-Genre-Classification-Techniques

## Goal
The Goal of this notebook is to test multiple different machine learning models to evaluate how they compare in music genre classification. 

## Instructions
Running the entire notebook should take approximately 3-4 hours on a GPU. This notebook is intended to be executed and tested on Google Colab, but can also be run elsewhere. 

Its advised when running this notebook in Google Colab to select Runtime -> Change Runtime Type and under Hardware accelerator select CPU or T4 GPU. A GPU is recommended for a faster experience running this notebook.

## Dataset
For this project we utilized the GTZAN Dataset
